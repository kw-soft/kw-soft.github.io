*Introducing My PacketMonitor Tool*

I’m thrilled to present **PacketMonitor**, an open-source project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kw-soft/PacketMonitor). This post outlines what PacketMonitor does and how it supports network traffic analysis.

*What is PacketMonitor?*

PacketMonitor is a network monitoring tool designed to capture and analyze network packets. It provides insights into the traffic flowing through a network, helping users understand communication patterns and identify potential security issues.

*What It Does*

The tool captures packets on a specified network interface and processes them to extract key information, such as source and destination IPs, protocols, and packet contents. It logs this data for analysis, allowing users to:
- Monitor real-time network activity.
- Inspect packet details for troubleshooting or security investigations.



*Getting Started*

To try PacketMonitor, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kw-soft/PacketMonitor) for setup instructions. Typically, you’ll need to:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kw-soft/PacketMonitor.git`
2. Install dependencies (e.g., Python libraries like `scapy`).
3. Run the tool on a compatible network interface.

Check the repository’s documentation for specific requirements and usage details.

*Wrapping Up*

PacketMonitor is a straightforward tool for anyone interested in network analysis or cybersecurity. I hope it helps you gain visibility into your network’s activity. Explore the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kw-soft/PacketMonitor), give it a star if you find it useful, and share your feedback!

Stay secure,
