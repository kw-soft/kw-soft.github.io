*QUIC Protocol: C2 Server*

Hey Everyone! I’m pumped to show off **QuicC2Py**, a neat project I’ve been tinkering with on [GitHub](https://github.com/kw-soft/QuicC2Py). It’s a proof-of-concept Command-and-Control (C2) system that’s all about learning and experimenting with network security. Want to dive into the nitty-gritty with us? Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BgUCmYP3px) to chat about this project and share ideas! Here’s the lowdown on what QuicC2Py is and what it can do.

*What’s QuicC2Py?*

QuicC2Py is a Python-based, modular C2 system built using the asyncio framework over UDP. It’s designed for educational purposes and authorized security testing, letting you explore how C2 systems work in a controlled environment. It uses AES encryption for secure communication and has a flexible client-server setup, perfect for digging into penetration testing, protocol development, or network security concepts.

*What It Does*

QuicC2Py packs some cool features for learning and testing:
- **UDP Communication**: Runs fast, low-latency exchanges over UDP on port 4433 (configurable).
- **AES Encryption**: Secures messages with 256-bit AES-CBC (hardcoded for demo purposes).
- **Interactive Commands**: Lets the server send commands like `whoami` (get username), `dir` (Windows directory listing), `ls` (Linux placeholder), `info` (system details), `upload`/`download` (basic file transfers), `help` (command list), or `exit` (clean shutdown).
- **Modular Setup**: Organized into modules for config, crypto, commands, and protocol, making it easy to tweak.
- **Logging**: Saves actions to `logs/udp_c2.log` for tracking what’s happening.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows and Linux (macOS may need tweaks).


*Getting Started*

Ready to check it out? Here’s how:

- **Run It Yourself**: Want to play with the code? Visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kw-soft/QuicC2Py) for full setup details. Quick steps:
  1. **Clone the Repo**:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KW-Soft/QuicC2Py.git
     cd QuicC2Py
     ```
  2. **Install Dependencies**:
     You’ll need Python 3.8+ and one key package:
     ```bash
     pip install cryptography
     ```
     (Optional: `pip install pytest` for running tests.)
  3. **Check Config**:
     Verify `config.json` for host, port (default 4433), and encryption settings.
  4. **Start the Server**:
     ```bash
     python src/server.py
     ```
     Then run the client:
     ```bash
     python src/client.py
     ```
     Use commands like `whoami` or `dir` from the server console.

See `docs/usage.md` in the repo for more details on interacting with clients.



*Wrapping It Up*

QuicC2Py is my take on a fun, educational C2 system for learning about network security in a safe, controlled way. **Important**: This is for authorized testing only—never use it without permission! If you dig it, drop a star and let me know what you think!

Stay safe,
