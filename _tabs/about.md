# 👋 Hi!

I’m Kevin Wilck, an IT specialist, AEVO certified trainer and self-taught developer based in Ludwigsfelde, near Berlin. With a strong passion for IT security, I focus on developing secure, efficient solutions using Python and managing Windows and Linux server environments to ensure robust system integrity.

Currently, I work as a Security Operations Center (SoC) Analyst, specializing in advanced threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management. In this role, I analyze complex attack patterns, correlate security events across multiple data sources, and contribute to the continuous improvement of detection and response strategies. My expertise is strengthened by CompTIA PenTest+ and Sophos certifications, enabling me to effectively safeguard digital environments against evolving threats.

As a dedicated HomeLab enthusiast, I continuously experiment and innovate in controlled environments to stay at the forefront of cybersecurity trends. Explore my portfolio, projects, and blog to discover my contributions to secure, cutting-edge technology.
